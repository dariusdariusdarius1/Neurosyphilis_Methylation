Neurosyphilis PBMCs and CSF DNA methylation and RNA expression before and after treatment

Neurosyphilis (NS) is a complication of syphilis that affects the nervous system. Epigenetic changes within immune cells may contribute to neuroinflammation during bacterial infection, but its role in NS has not yet been established. We longitudinally analyzed DNA methylation and RNA expression changes in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 11 participants with lab-confirmed NS (CSF VDRL positive) and 11 matched controls with syphilis without NS (non-NS). DNA methylation profiles from CSF and PBMCs of participants with NS significantly differed from those of participants with non-NS. Some genes associated with these differentially methylated sites had corresponding RNA expression changes in the CSF (111/1097, 10.1%), which were enriched in B-cell, cytotoxic-compounds, and insulin-response pathways. Despite antibiotic treatment, approximately 80% of CSF methylation changes persisted; suggesting that epigenetic scars accompanying NS may persistently dysregulate immunity following infection. Future studies must examine whether these sequelae are clinically meaningful.
